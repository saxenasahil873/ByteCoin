##ByteCoin

I developed this project using swift with the help of Udemy Course by "Dr. Angela Yu".

## What we will create

By the end of the module, we will have made a beautiful, dark-mode enabled Bytecoin app and also we are going to use Application Programming Interface (APIs) to grab live data from internet. We'll be able to check the currency rate for the currencies manually.
